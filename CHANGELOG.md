# Card Changelog

## 0.3.1
- Card editor: numeric fields (sensitivity, scroll, double-tap window, tap suppression) are easier to edit; labels show defaults so leaving a field blank falls back to a sensible value.

## 0.2.0
- Added keyboard and volume controls.
- Added remembering selected toggles (multiplier, lock, keyboard).

## 0.1.4
- First release.
